press <C-f> in cmdline mode to open command buffer

:! runs through external command
can use % as current buffer ie: :! python %

can use :shell
or :term depending on version of vim we're using
:read ![shell command] put stdout to terminal; can also be used to read a different buffer into current file
:write ![shell command] uses current buffer as stdin [probably better to use %, unless
there is something I don't understand like one being linewise and the other not]
