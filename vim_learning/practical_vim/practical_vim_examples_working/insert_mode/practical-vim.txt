#start on P; yt, jA, <C-r> 0
#note that that is within insert mode
#can also do <C-r><C-p> 0      which will paste more quickly/with no formatting errors but might just go back to normal mode instead of doing this;

Can also practice doing a yank with <C-o> y  and then pasting from insert as detailed above
